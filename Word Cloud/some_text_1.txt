Batman Beyond (1999-2001) is a spin off of the popular Batman cartoons of the 1990s and showed an aged and bitter Bruce Wayne (who had retired his Batman persona years before) train a young boy, Terry McGinnis, to be Batman and fight the criminals of the future. Terry had accidentally discovered the identity of the legendary Batman. He later steals the technologically advanced Batman costume so he could exact revenge after his father was killed by a powerful industrialist. The elderly Bruce Wayne eventually has sympathy for the boy and agrees to train the young man as an apprentice.
